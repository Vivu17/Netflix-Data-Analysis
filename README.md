# Netflix-Data-Analysis
I'm excited to share my recent project from the Power BI course on Udemy, I Collected the Data from Kaggle.com where I analyzed Netflix data to uncover valuable insights that can inform content strategy! 🚀

Key Highlights:

Data Transformation: 🛠️ I organized and prepared raw Netflix data using Power BI's advanced modeling tools, ensuring a solid foundation for analysis.

Error Identification & Removal: 🔍 By identifying and correcting missing values and inconsistencies, I enhanced the dataset's reliability and accuracy.

Data Cleaning: 🧹 I standardized the data to improve its relevance, making it more actionable for insights.

Visualizations: 📈 I developed dynamic dashboards that highlighted critical insights, such as the distribution of Movies vs. TV Shows, top-rated listings, and genre popularity.

This project not only honed my skills in data transformation and error handling but also strengthened my ability to tell compelling stories through data visualization. I’m looking forward to applying these insights in real-world scenarios and further advancing my data analysis journey!
